  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    AFCA Ready helps financial firms and consumers identify and correct
    procedural, governance, and fairness risks before they escalate into
    binding outcomes or regulatory consequences.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    AFCA outcomes are binding on member firms. Most adverse outcomes arise
    from process failure, poor reassessment, or weak evidence discipline —
    not from a lack of legal advice.
  </div>

  <p>
    AFCA Ready operates in the space between legal advice and operational
    reality, helping parties engage with AFCA in a way that aligns with its
    fairness-based approach.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="services">
  <h2>What We Do</h2>

  <h3>AFCA Failure-Point Diagnostics</h3>
  <p>

    document production, decision ownership, and reassessment practices.
  </p>

  <h3>Operational Readiness & Process Alignment</h3>
  <p>
    Support to align internal processes, evidence discipline, and decision
    reasoning with AFCA expectations.
  </p>

  <h3>AFCA Process Support (Non-Representative)</h3>
  <p>
    Assistance organising timelines, documents, and responses during AFCA
    engagement. No legal advice, representation, or claims management services
