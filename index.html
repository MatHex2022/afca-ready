<section id="purpose">
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    AFCA Ready helps financial firms and consumers identify and correct
    procedural, governance, and fairness risks before they escalate into
    binding outcomes or reputational damage.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    AFCA outcomes are shaped by fact patterns, conduct, and procedural fairness.
    Most adverse outcomes arise from process failure, weak reassessment practice,
    or poor evidence discipline — not from a lack of “arguments”.
  </div>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Important:</strong> AFCA Ready does not provide rule summaries, templates, or instructions.
    Our work focuses on how matters are handled in practice — timing, ownership of decisions,
    evidence handling, and fairness alignment — not how rules read in isolation.
  </div>

  <p class="muted">
    One-line moat: <strong>AFCA Ready focuses on how matters unfold in reality — not how rules read in theory.</strong>

  <h2>What We Do</h2>

  <h3>AFCA Readiness Diagnostics</h3>
  <p>
    We identify procedural and fairness exposure by reviewing how a matter has been handled over time —
    including complaint progression, reassessment conduct, evidence discipline, and decision accountability.
  </p>

  <h3>Process Alignment Review</h3>
  <p>
    We examine whether handling practices align with AFCA’s fairness-based expectations in practice,
    including whether issues were properly reconsidered, explained, and owned at each stage.
  </p>

  <h3>Engagement Support (Non-Representative)</h3>
  <p>
    We assist with organisation and clarity of materials during AFCA engagement.
    We do not provide submissions, arguments, or advocacy.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="deliverables">
  <h2>Deliverables</h2>

  <h3>AFCA Readiness Snapshot</h3>
  <p>
    A fixed-scope diagnostic intended to surface handling risks early.
    Deliverables are based on the specific materials reviewed and the way the matter has been handled to date.
    Findings are not generalised and cannot be generated through automated analysis.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>1–2 page written snapshot</strong> (Red / Amber / Green exposure indicators)</li>
    <li>Procedural risks observed (timeline, reassessment, evidence, decision ownership)</li>
    <li>Fairness alignment gaps (where the record doesn’t support the handling position)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Scope boundary:</strong> This is diagnostic and process-support work only.
    It is not legal advice, representation, or claims management.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="faq">
  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <h3>Can’t someone just paste this into an AI tool?</h3>
  <p>
    Anyone can copy information. The value of AFCA readiness is not information —
    it is judgement about how the record reads in practice across time, what is missing,
    and where process integrity breaks down under scrutiny. Automated tools do not reliably
    assess procedural fairness in messy, real-world files.
  </p>

  <h3>Do you tell people what to say to AFCA?</h3>
  <p>
    No. AFCA Ready does not provide submissions, arguments, or advocacy.
    We support evidence discipline, organisation, and clarity of materials — and identify
    process exposure points so decisions and reassessments can be owned and defensible.
  </p>

  <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consumers</strong> who want clarity before lodging or escalating.</li>
    <li><strong>Firms</strong> who want to reduce avoidable AFCA exposure driven by process failures.</li>
  </ul>
