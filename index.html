<section id="purpose">
  <h2>Purpose</h2>

  <p>
    AFCA Ready helps financial firms and consumers identify and correct procedural,
    governance, and fairness risks before they escalate into binding AFCA outcomes
    or reputational damage.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    AFCA outcomes are shaped by fact patterns, conduct, and procedural fairness.
    Most adverse outcomes arise from process failure, weak reassessment practice,
    or poor evidence discipline — not from a lack of “arguments”.
  </div>

  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> AFCA Ready does not provide rule summaries, templates,
    or instructions. Our work focuses on how matters are handled in practice —
    including timing, ownership of decisions, evidence handling, and
    <strong>procedural fairness</strong> — not how rules read in isolation.
  </p>

  <p>
    AFCA Ready examines how matters unfold across time and process — not isolated
    facts or arguments.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Do</h2>

  <h3>AFCA Readiness Diagnostics</h3>
  <p>
    Identification of procedural and fairness exposure by reviewing how a matter
    has been handled over time — including complaint progression, reassessment
    conduct, evidence discipline, and decision accountability.
  </p>

  <h3>Process Alignment Review</h3>
  <p>
    Examination of whether handling practices align with AFCA’s fairness-based
    expectations in practice, including whether issues were properly reconsidered,
    explained, and owned at each stage.
  </p>

  <h3>Engagement Support (Non-Representative)</h3>
  <p>
    Assistance with organisation and clarity of materials during AFCA engagement.
    No submissions, arguments, advocacy, or representation are provided.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="deliverables">
  <h2>Deliverables</h2>

  <h3>AFCA Readiness Snapshot</h3>
  <p>
    A fixed-scope diagnostic intended to surface handling risks early, based on
    the specific materials reviewed and how the matter has been handled to date.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>1–2 page written snapshot (Red / Amber / Green exposure indicators)</li>
    <li>Procedural risks observed (timeline, reassessment, evidence handling)</li>
    <li>Fairness alignment gaps where the record does not support the handling position</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Scope boundary:</strong> This is diagnostic and process-support work only.
    No legal advice, financial advice, representation, advocacy, or claims management
    services are provided.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="faq">
  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <h3>Can’t someone just paste this into an AI tool?</h3>
  <p>
    Anyone can copy information. The value of AFCA readiness is not information —
    it is judgement about how the record reads in practice across time, what is
    missing, and where process integrity breaks down under scrutiny. Automated
    tools do not reliably assess procedural fairness in real-world files.
  </p>

  <h3>Do you tell people what to say to AFCA?</h3>
  <p>
    No. AFCA Ready does not provide submissions, arguments, or advocacy. We support
    evidence discipline, organisation, and clarity of materials only.
  </p>

  <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
  <p>
    Consumers seeking clarity before lodging or escalating a complaint, and firms
    seeking to reduce avoidable AFCA exposure driven by process failure.
